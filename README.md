# 911 Call Data Analysis Capstone Project

This capstone project involves the analysis of 911 call data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes various fields such as latitude, longitude, emergency call description, zipcode, title, timestamp, township, address, and a dummy variable. The project aims to explore insights from the dataset using data analysis and visualization techniques.


## Introduction

In this capstone project, we dive into the 911 call dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to emergency calls. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to gain a better understanding of emergency call incidents and their characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains the following fields:

- Latitude (`lat`)
- Longitude (`lng`)
- Description of the Emergency Call (`desc`)
- Zipcode (`zip`)
- Title (`title`)
- Timestamp (`timeStamp`)
- Township (`twp`)
- Address (`addr`)
- Dummy Variable (`e`)

The dataset provides valuable information about emergency call incidents, including their geographical locations, nature of the emergency, timestamp, and more.


## Analysis

The analysis includes the following aspects:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of emergency call incidents by various attributes.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to showcase trends in call volume, incident types, and geographic patterns.
- Time-based analysis to identify patterns in emergency calls over different time periods.

The goal of the analysis is to uncover meaningful insights that can contribute to a better understanding of emergency call incidents.
